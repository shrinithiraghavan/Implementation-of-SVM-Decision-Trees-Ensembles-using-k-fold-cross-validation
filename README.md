Two different datasets are used in this project - 
1. SGEMM GPU Kernel Performance 
2. Classification of gilled Mushrooms 

The dataset can be downloaded from the following URLs

The main goal of the project is to understand the applications of different machine learning algorithms - Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Ensembles (Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest) and analyse the best model performance. The analysis on these datasets is done using Python and the code can be run sequentially in Jupyter Notebook.
